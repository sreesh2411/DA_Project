# Data Analytics Project
This repository contains the folders of the Data Analytics Project. Our topic for the project is "Data Analytics and Future Forecasting of COVID-19 Pandemic"

## Introduction
The outbreak of COVID-19 has affected over 218 countries around the world. The number of infected and deceased patients have been increasing at an alarming rate. It has therefore become necessary for the inculcation of forecasting techniques to develop better strategies and taking preventive decisions. In this study, we focus on in-depth analysis and forecasting techniques to predict the number of cases in the foreseeable future. These predictions might help to prepare against possible threats and consequences.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
For EDA, please refer to [DA_Visualizations2(Phase_1)]().

## Visualizations
The Visualizations are done in [DA_Visualizations(Phase_1)](). There are animations present in the notebooks of EDA and Visualizations have animations present in them. Hence, viewing them in a notebook viewer would be optimal.<br>
Some [Visualizations](https://github.com/sreesh2411/DA_Project/tree/main/Visualizations) are already taken out from the notebook:
* [Bar Plots](https://github.com/sreesh2411/DA_Project/tree/main/Visualizations/Bar%20Plots) 
* [Bubble Charts](https://github.com/sreesh2411/DA_Project/tree/main/Visualizations/Bubble%20Charts)
  * [Continent-Wise](https://github.com/sreesh2411/DA_Project/tree/main/Visualizations/Bubble%20Charts/Continent%20Wise)
  * [Country-Wise](https://github.com/sreesh2411/DA_Project/tree/main/Visualizations/Bubble%20Charts/Country%20Wise)
* [Geo Plots](https://github.com/sreesh2411/DA_Project/tree/main/Visualizations/Geo%20Plots) 
* [Advanced Visualiaztions](https://github.com/sreesh2411/DA_Project/tree/main/Visualizations/Advanced%20Viz) 
  * [USA](https://github.com/sreesh2411/DA_Project/tree/main/Visualizations/Advanced%20Viz/USA)
  * [India](https://github.com/sreesh2411/DA_Project/tree/main/Visualizations/Advanced%20Viz/India)
